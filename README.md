## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   # Jira Configuration
   JIRA_URL=https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net
   USERNAME=your-email@example.com
   TOKEN=your-api-token

   # File Paths
   INPUT_FILE=data/input_file.xlsx
   NEW_OUTPUT_JSON=data/formatted_last_3_comments.json
   REPORT_FILE=data/final_report.csv
   DB_FILE=data/jira_comments.db

   # Slack Integration
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/slack/webhook
   ```

2. Prepare your input Excel file (`input_file.xlsx`) with the following structure:

   | Key      | Components |
   | -------- | ---------- |
   | PROJ-123 | Frontend   |
   | PROJ-124 | Backend    |

3. Add a file `excluded_users.txt` (optional) to define users to exclude from reports:

   ```plaintext
   John Doe
   Jane Smith
   ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Run the script with the following commands:

1. **Generate Reports**:

   ```bash
   python cli_integration.py --generate-report
   ```

2. **Save to Database**:

   ```bash
   python cli_integration.py --save-to-database
   ```

3. **Send Report to Slack**:

   ```

4. **Combine Actions**:

   ```bash
   python cli_integration.py --generate-report --save-to-database --slack-me
   ```

### Tableau Integration

After running the `--save-to-database` command, connect Tableau to the SQLite database:

1. Open Tableau.
2. Connect to the database file (`jira_comments.db`).
3. Visualize the data using Tableau's drag-and-drop interface.

### Slack Integration

Ensure your Slack webhook URL is set in the `.env` file. Run the following command to send reports:

```bash
python cli_integration.py --slack-me
```

## Example Files

You'll find the following example files in the `data` directory:

1. **`sample_input.xlsx`**: A template for input data with example Jira issue keys and components.

2. **`excluded_users.txt`**: A template for excluded users.

## Example Output

### JSON File (`formatted_last_3_comments.json`):

```json
[
    {
        "Instance": "https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net",
        "Issue Key": "PROJ-123",
        "Component": "Frontend",
        "Comment-1": "The feature is not working as expected.",
        "Author-1": "John Doe",
        "Email-1": "john@example.com",
        "Created-1": "2025-01-10T12:34:56Z",
        "Comment-2": "I have fixed the issue.",
        "Author-2": "Jane Smith",
        "Email-2": "jane@example.com",
        "Created-2": "2025-01-11T08:22:33Z",
        "Comment-3": "The fix has been deployed.",
        "Author-3": "John Doe",
        "Email-3": "john@example.com",
        "Created-3": "2025-01-12T09:45:12Z"
    }
]
```

### Slack Notification:

```plaintext
New comments have been processed for the following Jira issues:

- **PROJ-123 (Frontend)**
  - *John Doe*: The feature is not working as expected.
  - *Jane Smith*: I have fixed the issue.
  - *John Doe*: The fix has been deployed.

Check the detailed report for more information.
```

### Slack Notification:

## Slack Integration

JiraQuest can send automated reports or insights directly to a specified Slack channel using a webhook URL. Follow these steps to configure and use Slack notifications:

### Step 1: Set Up a Slack Webhook URL

1. Go to your Slack workspace and navigate to **Settings & Administration > Manage Apps**.
2. Search for **Incoming Webhooks** and click **Add to Slack**.
3. Choose a channel where JiraQuest notifications should appear.
4. Copy the webhook URL provided (e.g., `https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url`).

### Step 2: Add the Webhook URL to the .env File

Add the Slack webhook URL to your `.env` file:

```plaintext
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url
```

### Step 3: Send Reports to Slack

Run the following command to send the latest report to Slack:

```bash
python cli_integration.py --slack-me
```

### How It Works

JiraQuest composes a summary of the latest Jira comments or a report and sends it to the specified Slack channel using the webhook.

Example notification format:

```plaintext
ðŸ”” JiraQuest Alert ðŸš€ New Insights from Jira Comments:
Issue Key: PROJ-123
Component: Frontend
Latest Comment: "The feature is not working as expected."
Author: John Doe
Timestamp: 2025-01-10 12:34:56
```

### Step 4: Customize Slack Notifications (Optional)

To customize the notification format:

1. Open the `slack_integration.py` file in the `src/jiraquest/` directory.
2. Modify the payload structure in the `send_to_slack` function.
