   TOKEN=your-api-token
   ```

3. Run the CLI:
   ```bash
   jiraquest --generate-report
   ```

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   # Jira Configuration
   JIRA_URL=https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net
   USERNAME=your-email@example.com
   TOKEN=your-api-token

   # File Paths
