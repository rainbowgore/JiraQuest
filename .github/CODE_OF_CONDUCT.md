## JiraQuest Pledge

Welcome to our vibrant community! We, as members, contributors, and leaders, are dedicated to making this space harassment-free, welcoming, and inspiring for everyone. Regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity, experience level, or whether you prefer tabs over spaces—you belong here.

We pledge to be kind, supportive, and professional in everything we do, creating a space where collaboration and creativity can thrive.

## Our Standards

Here's what we're all about:

### Behavior That Makes This Place Awesome:
- Showing kindness, empathy, and respect—always.
- Being open to different perspectives and constructive feedback.
- Owning our mistakes, apologizing when needed, and learning from them.
- Working for the good of the entire community, not just ourselves.

### Behavior That’s Absolutely Not Cool:
- Using offensive or sexualized language, images, or advances.
- Insulting, trolling, or attacking others—whether personally or politically.
- Harassment of any kind (public or private).
- Sharing someone’s private info (email, address, etc.) without permission.
- Any conduct that’s unprofessional or just plain mean.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Our community leaders are here to ensure that this space remains a safe and productive environment for everyone. They’ll address inappropriate behavior with fairness and transparency, taking corrective action when needed.

They also have the right to edit, remove, or reject contributions that don’t align with these standards—and they’ll let you know why when they do.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies everywhere: in our community spaces, at events, and even in public spaces where you’re representing this community. That means using official emails, social accounts, or wearing our swag makes you an ambassador of our values.

## Enforcement

If something goes against this Code, let us know at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]. We’ll review and handle every report promptly, fairly, and confidentially.

Leaders will respect your privacy and ensure your concerns are addressed with care.

## Enforcement Guidelines

We’ll follow these steps to address violations:

### 1. Friendly Reminder
**Community Impact**: Minor missteps (e.g., inappropriate jokes or off-topic comments).

**Consequence**: A private note reminding the person about the community’s standards, along with encouragement to improve.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A noticeable incident or repeated behavior.

**Consequence**: A formal warning, potentially restricting interactions with others for a time. Further issues could result in a ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: Serious misconduct or continued violations.

**Consequence**: A time-limited ban from community spaces and activities. Conditions for rejoining will be clearly outlined.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Extreme or repeated violations, such as harassment or harmful behavior.
